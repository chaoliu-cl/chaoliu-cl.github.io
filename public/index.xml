      <description>I grew up in a southern coastal city of China and made my way to the United States in 2010, driven by a deep desire to pursue graduate degrees in psychology and make a positive impact on the lives of children in need. In 2013, I earned my master&amp;rsquo;s degree in developmental psychology from the University of Maine.
During my time at the university, I came to realize the profound influence that families have on child development.</description>

      <description>This study observed 81 children playing with their mothers and fathers separately to examine how parent and child gender, as well as play context, influenced parental play roles. The findings revealed complex interactions between gender and play context, with parents adopting different roles (director, facilitator, or co-player) based on the child&amp;#39;s gender and the type of game, highlighting the significant impact of these factors on parent-child play dynamics.</description>

      <description>This study utilized text mining and sentiment analysis on mother-child conversations to examine the developmental trends in their interactions from early to middle childhood. The findings revealed a shift towards more balanced interactions as children age, with increased turn-taking dynamics and linguistic congruence, as well as a complex interdependence of expressed emotions between mothers and children over time.</description>

      <description>This study employed text mining and sentiment analysis on over 8,800 mother-child conversation transcripts to examine dynamic patterns of emotion expression, revealing distinct temporal trends in emotional sentiment for both mothers and children. The research identified clusters of mothers and children with varying emotion expression patterns, and demonstrated how mother-child polarity score differences fluctuated throughout conversations, showcasing the potential of these analytical methods for understanding parent-child interactions and informing relationship-focused interventions.</description>
