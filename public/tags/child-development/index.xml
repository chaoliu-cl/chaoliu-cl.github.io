      <description>This study observed 81 children playing with their mothers and fathers separately to examine how parent and child gender, as well as play context, influenced parental play roles. The findings revealed complex interactions between gender and play context, with parents adopting different roles (director, facilitator, or co-player) based on the child&amp;#39;s gender and the type of game, highlighting the significant impact of these factors on parent-child play dynamics.</description>

The research identified clusters of mothers and children with varying emotion expression patterns, and demonstrated how mother-child polarity score differences fluctuated throughout conversations, showcasing the potential of these analytical methods for understanding parent-child interactions and informing relationship-focused interventions.</description>
