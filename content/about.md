I grew up in a southern coastal city of China and made my way to the United States in 2010, driven by a deep desire to pursue graduate degrees in psychology and make a positive impact on the lives of children in need. In 2013, I earned my master's degree in developmental psychology from the University of Maine.

During my time at the university, I came to realize the profound influence that families have on child development. This sparked a passion within me, compelling me to incorporate the study of family dynamics and their impact on child well-being into my doctoral research. It was a path I felt compelled to follow.

In August of 2018, after years of study, I successfully completed my Ph.D. in Human Development and Family Sciences at Oklahoma State University. Soon after, I joined the faculty at Cedarville University, ready to share my knowledge and expertise with those like-minded students who are about to make a meaningful difference in the world.

Beyond the realms of academia, I find solace and exhilaration in the great outdoors. As an avid outdoor enthusiast, I relish every opportunity to go hiking, camping, and backpacking, especially when accompanied by my beautiful wife. These moments spent in nature not only rejuvenate my spirit but also provide an opportunity to deepen our connection and share unforgettable experiences.

But our adventures go beyond the thrill of exploration. We find great joy in using our journeys as a platform to spread the Gospel, sharing the transformative power of faith with the people we meet along the way. It's a unique way to combine our love for nature, our commitment to helping others, and our faith in Christ.

My life's journey has been shaped by a deep-rooted passion for science, a belief in the importance of family, and an insatiable thirst for adventure. As I continue to explore the vast realms of knowledge, immerse myself in the wonders of nature, and touch the lives of those around me, I am constantly reminded of the profound love that Jesus demonstrated for me, and for you.
