We will collect a diverse dataset comprising written exchanges between parents and children, spanning various contexts such as emails, chat messages, and social media interactions. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, sentiment analysis, and machine learning models, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and shifts in emotional content over time.
